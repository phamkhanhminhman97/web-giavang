# Redirect Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up proper redirects from the non-www version of the site (http://giavang247.online) to the www version (https://www.giavang247.online). This is important for SEO purposes to avoid duplicate content issues and ensure that all pages are properly indexed by search engines.

## Why This Is Important

When both the www and non-www versions of a site are accessible, search engines may see them as duplicate content, which can negatively impact your SEO. Additionally, it can cause issues with analytics, cookies, and other tracking mechanisms.

## Implementation Options

We've provided several configuration files for different server environments. Choose the one that matches your hosting environment:

### 1. Apache Server (.htaccess)

If your site is hosted on an Apache server:

1. Upload the `.htaccess` file to the root directory of your website.
2. Test the redirect by visiting http://giavang247.online - it should automatically redirect to https://www.giavang247.online.

### 2. Nginx Server (nginx.conf)

If your site is hosted on an Nginx server:

1. Modify your server's Nginx configuration using the provided `nginx.conf` as a reference.
2. Update the SSL certificate paths in the configuration.
3. Reload the Nginx configuration with `sudo nginx -t` to test and `sudo systemctl reload nginx` to apply.

### 3. IIS Server (web.config)

If your site is hosted on a Windows IIS server:

1. Upload the `web.config` file to the root directory of your website.
2. Test the redirect by visiting http://giavang247.online.

### 4. HTML Fallback (non-www-redirect.html)

If you don't have access to server configuration:

1. Upload the `non-www-redirect.html` file to the root directory of the non-www domain.
2. Rename it to `index.html` on the non-www domain.
3. This will provide a client-side redirect, though it's not as efficient as a server-side redirect.

## DNS Configuration

Ensure that both the www and non-www versions of your domain are properly configured in your DNS settings:

1. Create an A record for `giavang247.online` pointing to your server's IP address.
2. Create an A record for `www.giavang247.online` pointing to the same IP address.
3. Alternatively, create a CNAME record for `www` pointing to `giavang247.online`.

## Verifying the Redirect

After implementing the redirect, verify that it works correctly:

1. Visit http://giavang247.online in your browser.
2. You should be automatically redirected to https://www.giavang247.online.
3. Check that the redirect is a 301 (permanent) redirect using tools like [httpstatus.io](https://httpstatus.io).

## Testing in Google Search Console

To ensure Google recognizes the redirect properly:

1. Add both the www and non-www versions of your site to Google Search Console.
2. Use the URL Inspection tool to check how Google sees the redirect.
3. Monitor for any crawl errors related to the redirect.

## Common Issues

- **Redirect Loops**: Ensure your configuration doesn't create an infinite redirect loop.
- **Mixed Content Warnings**: Make sure all resources (images, scripts, etc.) are loaded over HTTPS.
- **Cache Issues**: Users who have previously visited the non-www version might need to clear their browser cache.
